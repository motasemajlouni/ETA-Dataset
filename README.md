# ETA-Dataset
ETA dataset (ETA2024.json) is a valuable resource for training data-driven models for SR task.

The ETA dataset is robust, boasting a substantial volume of data comprising 150,825 samples meticulously curated from a pool of over 9.2 million generated samples. Within this dataset, one finds 150,825 distinct complex sentences, showcasing a rich vocabulary of 120,743 unique words. The dataset exhibits a wide spectrum of sentence lengths, with the longest complex sentence extending to 90 words, while the shortest is a concise 9 words, resulting in an average length of 36.1 words per complex sentence. In contrast, simplified sentences are notably shorter, averaging 13.8 words each. Additionally, the dataset reflects a broad range of simplification ratios, averaging 2.6 simplified sentences per complex sentence and ranging from 1 to 15. This ensures a comprehensive representation of linguistic diversity and complexity.


 While the ETA dataset spans a broad spectrum of simplification ratios (S/C) ranging from 1 to 15, the majority of samples fall within S/C values of 2 and 3. To achieve a more balanced distribution, we select a subset(ETA_balanced_subset.json) with a more even representation of simplification ratios. The longest complex sentence in the subset contains 88 words, while the shortest has 9 words, with an average of 38.1 words per complex sentence (T/C). In contrast, simplified sentences are significantly shorter, averaging 10.3 words each. The subset maintains an average of 3.7 simplified sentences per complex sentence (S/C), with the ratios spanning the entire range from 1 to 15. This balanced subset ensures a diverse yet controlled representation of linguistic complexity.
